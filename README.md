# Always--Down
 This is my new game called Always Down. Once the player go down the camera also moves down at a point so the player cannot go up that's why I named this game as ALWAYS DOWN.
- Sprite renderers used to animate player while moving and also for enemies
- 4 different enemies with different functionality
- Ground enemy hit and die
- Fire glow and disappear in fixed time period
- Blade will moves to and fro motion
- Spike will spawn and go back to ground
- Player can fire bullet and kill enemies to take points
